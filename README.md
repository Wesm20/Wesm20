- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wesm20
- 👀 I’m interested in learning different computer languages to utilize the best language for sharing data and optimmizing existing services, such as transferring .text data to an output and copying it to a PDF.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, VBA and SQL but I am most proficient in Python. Python is my first programming language, or does Excel count?
- 💞️ I’m posting my personal projects so I can use them between my different computers and to utilize GitHub more efficiently.
- 📫 When I am more efficient in using GitHub I will post my contact information.
- 😄 Pronouns: He - but not him, because I'll never be him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I recently began to explore programming languages and wish I would have started many years ago!
